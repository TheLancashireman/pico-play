# TheLancashireman's pico playground.

## What's this?

This subdirectory contains some code that I hacked together to learn about the RP2040 processor
and the Raspberry Pi Pico development board.

The aim of the game is to prepare the way for porting davroska to the pico.

Just the basic stuff one might need to get started on a simple bare-metal project:

* Load code directly into RAM via the onboard UF2 loader.
* Set the GPIO to blink the onboard LED.
* Set the PLL to run at the full 133 MHz.
* Use the timer - cortex M SysTick - to measure time reasonably accurately.
* Use the uart to communicate with the outside world.
* Basic interrupt handling using a software trigger.

Getting the code out of the flash and into the RAM is an exercise for later, as is the execute-in-place
mode.

# WARNING

The enclosed shell script, to-pico.sh, copies the UF2 file to the pico. To do that, it tries to
mount /dev/sdc1 at /media/pico. It requires supervisor rights (sudo) in order to do that.
You may have to enter your password to obtain those rights.

Ensure that you read and understand the script before using it.

# Development history

You can find all the stages in the git history.

## 1st iteration

Copied from STM32 playground and bigly hacked. Heartbeat is a double pulse with a frequency of
nominally 72 beats per minute. No PLL initialisation, uses softwareÂ timing loops for delays.
The loop in the delay() function is six instructions. The delay factor of 800 means that 4800 instructions
are executed every millisecond - which suggests a CPU clock frequency of about 5 MHz. That is
compatible with the range of frequencies given for the ring oscillator (see RP2040 refman 2.15.2.1)

## 2nd iteration

Enable the crystal oscillator and use it for the cores. Now runs at 12 MHz - about twice as fast.

## 3rd iteration

Enable and configure the PLL for 133 MHz operation. Increase the delay_factor to slow down the blink rate
to approximately the speed it was in the 1st iteration.

## 4th iteration

Switch to using systick as timer. The "implementation-defined" clock frequency is 1 MHz, according to the
ref. manual. Beat rate is now a reasonably accurate 72 beats per minute.

## 5th iteration

Add uart support - 115200/8N1. Send a character on each beat. Echo characters that are received.

IMPORTANT: you have to initialise IOBANK0 before initialising the uart.
