# pico-playground

I bought a Raspberry Pi Pico board. These are my first simple projects for it.

"blink" is a simple LED blinker using the SDK. However, that carries the whole baggage of the SDK with it.
Among other things, it's slow to build. I want to run davroska on the board, so I need to understand the actual
hardware a bit better.

The rest of the projects are inspired by David Welch's pico-baremetal projects:
